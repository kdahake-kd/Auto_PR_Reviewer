# Additional Features to Impress Interviewers
# 1️⃣ Web Dashboard for PR Analysis Results
# Create a React frontend to display AI feedback visually.
# Show each PR’s analysis results in a structured format (tables, highlights, graphs).
# Allow searching PRs by ID and filtering issues by type (style, bug, performance, etc.).
# 2️⃣ AI-Powered Code Auto-Fixes
# Extend the LLM model to suggest fixes and even generate improved code snippets.
# Provide a "Fix Code" button that generates corrected code based on AI suggestions.
# 3️⃣ Slack/Email Notifications for PR Feedback
# Send email or Slack notifications when analysis is complete.
# Let users subscribe to notifications so they can get feedback instantly.

# Additional Features to Impress the Interviewer
# Add Authentication & Authorization

# Secure the API using JWT or OAuth for role-based access.
# Only mentors should access certain endpoints.
# Generate Reports

# Store AI analysis results in a database.
# Allow users to download feedback reports in PDF format.
# Email Notifications

# Send automated emails to developers once their PR analysis is ready.

# 1. AI-Powered "Fix & Commit" Button
# 🔹 Unlike Jenkins, which only reports issues, your system can fix the code automatically and commit it back to the repository.
# 🔹 The AI generates context-aware fixes and directly creates a new PR or updates the existing one.
# 🔹 Example: If AI detects a performance issue, it suggests an optimized version and commits the fix.

# 👉 Unique Benefit: No manual intervention—your system can auto-correct PRs without human review if enabled.

# 🛠️ 2. Auto-Generated PR Summaries with AI
# 🔹 After analysis, your system writes a concise PR summary explaining:
# ✅ What issues were found (e.g., security vulnerabilities, style issues)
# ✅ What was fixed (if auto-fix is enabled)
# ✅ Suggested improvements

# 👉 Unique Benefit: Developers don’t need to manually write PR descriptions—AI does it for them.

# 📊 3. Developer Performance Metrics & Insights
# 🔹 Unlike Jenkins, your system can track:
# 📌 Which developers introduce the most issues (bugs, performance problems)
# 📌 Which PRs have the highest review delays
# 📌 Trend analysis on PR quality over time

# 👉 Unique Benefit: Helps managers and teams identify skill gaps and optimize workflows.

# 🤖 4. AI-Based PR Approval Automation
# 🔹 Instead of waiting for human approval, your system can:
# ✅ Automatically approve PRs that pass AI checks (no major issues)
# ✅ Assign specific reviewers based on detected issue types
# ✅ Block merges if critical security or performance issues are found

# 👉 Unique Benefit: Saves review time and prevents bad PRs from being merged.

# 🔐 5. AI-Driven Code Review Customization Per Team/Repo
# 🔹 Your AI learns from past PRs and adapts feedback per team/project:
# ✅ Team A prefers Python f-strings? AI enforces it.
# ✅ Team B wants strict TypeScript typings? AI adapts.

# 👉 Unique Benefit: Unlike Jenkins (which applies static rules), your system learns and adapts to team coding styles.

# 📢 6. Real-Time Developer Chatbot (Slack/Teams)
# 🔹 AI chatbot in Slack/Teams where developers can:
# 💬 Ask for code fixes in natural language (e.g., “Why is this PR failing?”)
# 📌 Get instant AI suggestions without opening the dashboard
# 🚀 Trigger auto-fixes from chat itself

# 👉 Unique Benefit: No need to log into the platform—fix PRs from Slack/Teams.

# 🔥 7. Live Code Simulation for Performance Bottlenecks
# 🔹 Before merging a PR, your system:
# ✅ Runs a simulated load test to detect slow code
# ✅ Suggests optimizations based on real execution data
# ✅ Shows expected performance impact of merging

# 👉 Unique Benefit: Prevents slow code from being merged (Jenkins doesn’t do this).

# 💡 The Ultimate Edge:
# Unlike Jenkins (which just reports issues), your system actively fixes PRs, learns coding styles, auto-commits improvements, and integrates with developers via chatbots.
